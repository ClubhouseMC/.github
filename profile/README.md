ClubhouseMC is a Minecraft Network on the Java version of Minecraft.

At ClubhouseMC, we believe in creating a warm, welcoming, and fun environment for Minecraft  players of all ages. Our server is built on the principles of community, creativity, and collaboration. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the world of Minecraft, you'll find a place here among friends. 

ClubhouseMC was founded by LGLOVER and iEddie, who have played Minecraft for over 10+ years. After exploring and playing throughout hundreds of servers, they wanted to put together what they have learned about servers and make one of their own to give everyone out there the best experience that any Minecraft server can give. After a server which they frequented for many years and made many friends on closed its doors, it became the spark that ignited the flame behind creating ClubhouseMC.
